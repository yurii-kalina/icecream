                                by the inconsistency of other decentralized finance forks. We developed our protocol with the two pillars
                                of honesty and integrity, which we as a team will uphold by remaining community based and vocal upon
                                all developments. IceCream Finance was KYC'd by Assure Defi pre-launch to demonstrate our beliefs.
                                We have implemented community voting on important decisions and continue to educate investors as much
                                as possible to protect their capital in all investments.</p>
